## Custom Domain Setup

After deploying to any platform above:
1. Purchase a domain name (e.g., `worknorway.com`)
2. Follow your hosting platform's documentation to add a custom domain
3. Update DNS settings as instructed

## Post-Deployment

After deployment, consider:
- Setting up a backend for the contact form (currently client-side only)
- Adding analytics (Google Analytics, Plausible, etc.)
- Setting up email notifications for form submissions
- Adding multilingual support (Norwegian, Finnish, English, etc.)

## Contact Form Backend Options

To make the contact form functional, you can:

1. **Formspree** (easiest): Replace the form action with Formspree endpoint
2. **Netlify Forms**: If using Netlify, add `netlify` attribute to form
3. **Custom Backend**: Create an API endpoint to handle form submissions
4. **EmailJS**: Client-side email service

Example with Formspree:
```html
<form action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
```

## Updating the Site

After deployment, any changes pushed to the main branch will automatically redeploy (for GitHub Pages, Netlify, and Vercel).
